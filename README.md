# DiskSpaceChecker
Recursively scans all folders and subfolders in a designated path and returns list of folders with total file size, count and date range.

This is a simple C# console app. It was written to help identify folders which need to be archived. In Windows it is quite straightforward to find individual file sizes, but not so easy to get total size used by a folder - especially for a list of folders, or all folders on a network drive for instance.

This is essentially a simple version of the old freeware app SpaceMonger.
